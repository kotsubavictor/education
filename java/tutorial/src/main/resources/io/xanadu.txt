The Walt Disney World Railroad is a 3-foot (914 mm) narrow-gauge American heritage railroad
and attraction that encircles most of the Magic Kingdom theme park of Walt
Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida. Constructed by WED Enterprises, it has three train s
tations along 1.5 miles (2.4 km) of track, and four historic steam locomotives, originally built by Ba
ldwin Locomotive Works. On a typical day, two or three locomotives will complete round trips in 20 minutes o
n the main line. The railroad's development was led by Roger E. Broggie. The attraction's locomotives were acqu
ired from the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucat√°n, a narrow-gauge railroad system in Mexico, and altered to resemble locomotiv
es built in the 1880s. The passenger cars were built from scratch. The railroad opened to the public for the first ti
me on the theme park's opening day, October 1, 1971. Since then, it has become one of the world's most popular stea
m-powered railroads, with about 3.7 million passengers each year. (Full article...)
